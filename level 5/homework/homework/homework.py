# Task1

dog_name1 = "Rick"
#Here we call a variable to which we assign the word Rick
dog_name2 = "John"
#Also here we called the variable to which we assigned the word John
·Éêdog_name3 = "Max"
#We called the variable to which we assigned the word Max

#All these three variables that we called are string type variables
#In all three called variables snake_case is used which 
#Makes it easier to read sentences that contain many words.

print("First dog's name is " + "" + dog_name1 + ". " + "Second dog's name is " + "" + dog_name2 + ".")

#And regarding this, we displayed the sentences on the screen with the print command
# are created as a result of the given three called variables. How does this happen? 
#taken is an unfinished sentence First dog's name is us to form a complete sentence
# With the help of the given variable, we should add to the unfinished sentence such as First dog's name is and
#Add the name of the given variable, after that the computer will go back and find the variable that we entered
#And instead of the variable, it inserts the word that you assigned to the called variable, in this case Rick
