  // Task 2

  // Presentational and container components are the division of site pages into components that are used when the page 
  // is both logically and structurally loaded. Therefore, we have presentational and container components where we 
  // already divide pages. The presentational component contains only the rendering part and all the objects that are 
  // visible on the site, while the container component contains the entire functionality and logic of this page. 
  // We use this in cases where the page is loaded and we want the page to be more understandable and perceived both as 
  // a functional and a rendering part, 
  // so we divide these pages into two parts: presentational and container components.
