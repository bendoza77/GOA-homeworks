  // Task 2

  // When we call a component as an empty tag, we can write props to it as a container tag, but the difference 
  // between them is that when we call a component as a container tag, then we cannot create child elements in it, 
  // such as jsx elements, paragraph buttons, and so on. And when we call a component as a container tag, then we 
  // can already create as many child elements as we want, but these child elements must be passed to the component so that we 
  // can display it in the browser or perform some specific action.

  
  // Task 3

  // The children element in JSX is a special prop that is all the elements that are created in the component that 
  // is called as a container tag and all the child elements in it are displayed as children elements and as props, 
  // you must also pass the children element to the 
  // component to display all the child elements in the browser.
