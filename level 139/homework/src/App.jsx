  // Task 1

  // The wrapper component is a component we create in the context in which we set the children value. 
  // This means that all components that are included in this wrapper component will share the information 
  // that we pass through the provider component. In this wrapper component, we use the entire app component. 
  // This means that I can share the 
  // information that I pass through the value attribute with all components and pages.


  // Task 2

  // Props drilling is a moment when we need to pass information to many components, for example, when we 
  // have 10 components and all 10 components are rendered in the same way and we want to pass information to 
  // the 10th component first. I am given the opportunity to pass information to all components up to the 10th 
  // component, to get to the 10th component. This is called props drilling. When you want to pass information 
  // to components 1-0 and you want to go deeper to get to it,
  //  for this you have to pass information to all components up to the 10th component.
