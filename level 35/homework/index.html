    <!-- Task 2 -->

    <!-- static is one of the position properties values ​​which means the default value 
     and returns the normal state of the html element -->

    <!-- absolute is one of the values ​​of the position properties that will be placed on the new layer 
     by the element to which you write this value -->

    <!-- relative is one of the values ​​of the position property, when you write it to the html element, it
      will be displayed normally, but we can change the location with the left and top properties -->

    <!-- fixed is one of the position propertys values, which, if written, will never hide the element when the 
     screen is pulled down, so it is often used to make a navbar. -->

    <!-- sticky is the value of the position property and is similar to fixed, but the difference is that when we 
     want the navbar to be visible during the header, and if the screen is pulled down, only the element with this value remains. -->


    <!-- The difference between absolute and relative is that abolutes moves the element to a new layer, and when we 
     write left or top, the countdown starts from the top of the site wall, while writing relative doesn't move the element 
     to a new layer, while left- If you write it and top, the countdown starts from where that element is -->



     <!-- Task 3 -->

     <!-- When you apply position: relative to an element, you can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to move the element from its original position. This doesn’t affect the layout of other elements; it just changes the position of the element itself relative to where it would -->

     <!-- With position absolute we can move the element to a new layer and change the location with left, top, button, right properties. -->

    <!-- With position fixed, we can create a navbar. This value is very useful for elements that you want to stay on the entire screen, even when they are collapsed. -->

    <!-- With postion sticky, we can create a sticky navbar -->

    <!-- With position static, we simply return the element to the default position  -->
